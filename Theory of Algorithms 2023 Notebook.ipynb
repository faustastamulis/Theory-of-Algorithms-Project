    "The is prime function takes an integer n, and if n is a prime number, returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function initially determines whether n falls into one of two unique categories that are prime: less than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3. Following that, the function determines if n is divisible by the non-prime numbers 2 or 3. As all prime numbers higher than 3 may be expressed in the manner 6k 1, the function then tests odd integers from 5 up to the square root of n in increments of 6. Any of these odd numbers can divide n, proving that it is not a prime number."
