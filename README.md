# Theory of Algorithms 
This is my Github Repository to the assessment that I must complete for the 2023 Theory of Algorithms module. My name is Faustas Tamulis (G00373028@atu.ie). I am a final year full-time student at ATU(Atlantic Technological University). In this assignment we will be talking about the topic of The Polynomial Time
Complexity Class (P).

## Part 1: Description of Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)
## Part 2: Problems with P
## Part 3: Relationship with NP
## Part 4: Differences between P and NP
